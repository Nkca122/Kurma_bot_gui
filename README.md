# 🐢 Kurma Bot GUI

**Kurma Bot GUI** is a versatile graphical interface designed to streamline the process of building, testing, and managing AI/ML models—particularly those used for robotics and computer vision tasks. Built using **PySide6/PyQt**, this tool aims to simplify **data collection**, **model management**, **visualization**, and upcoming **hardware control features**.

---

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ Current Features
- **Model Integration**: Easily integrate and view YOLO-based models using [Ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics).
- **GUI with PySide6/PyQt**: Intuitive and responsive user interface designed for efficiency.
- **Model Viewer**: Load and inspect models, including layers, parameters, and outputs.
- **Annotation System (Coming Soon)**: Built-in annotation tools to make data labeling fast and efficient.
- **Controller Support**: Basic controller functionality included for managing bot actions (WIP).
- **Modular Design**: Clean architecture for easy future expansion.

### 🔜 Coming Soon
- 📷 **Annotation Tool**: Manually label images or videos directly within the GUI.
- 🌐 **Wi-Fi Bot Controller**: Connect to and control a physical bot over Wi-Fi.
- 🧠 **Training Dashboard**: Monitor training metrics and progress in real-time.
- 📦 **Dataset Management**: Organize, filter, and prepare your datasets for training.
- 🔧 **Hardware Integration**: Control sensors and actuators from within the app.
